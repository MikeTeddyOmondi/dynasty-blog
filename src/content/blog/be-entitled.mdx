What is the story you tell yourself when no one is watching you?

What’s that story when it’s just you and your wildest dreams and desire?

The story you tell when you dig deep into your faith and you can see the efforts you put towards a particular thing?

What do you really tell yourself?

Let’s assume you get an opportunity, do you walk in the room saying am going to get it, that this is already mine and that all I have to is figure out is how to make it happen?

Or

Do you walk in the room saying you don’t deserve this, question how you are going to achieve this and hope for luck to dwell upon you to get grasp of the opportunity?

> *If it comes let it, if it goes let it*

I have come to the understanding that the mindset which you attach yourself to something or rather the mindset to which you attack something with really determines the overall outcome. Be it financial goals, professional goals, emotional or spiritual growth, it really doesn’t matter much if your mentality aint right. There is a very big difference between people who already know they have it and are working towards what they already have as opposed to those who are not sure and are kind of winging their way through things.

Let’s reason this out, am not into physical fitness that much but I believe if you have body goals that can only be achieved through proper dieting and physical dieting. Similarly, if you are yearning for that job or that promotion, you then have to increase your skills and or add some more papers. Let’s also say you desire to get some financial freedom, then having financial planning with the aid of an advisor may come in handy.

I believe that approaching life with a little bit of a positive attitude paves way for you to accomplish your desires. Having a mindset of thinking *‘it’s mine, I just need to put myself in the right place to get it’* goes a long way in actualizing our delusions. This mindset separates you from one who waits on luck and expectations.

To break this down, inculcating a mindset of ownership and believe you have achieved you goals while being in the state of figuring out how to actually make it happens, helps develop a sense of ENTITLEMENT. I have come to the realization that being entitled gets you what you want and knowing that what you want is yours for the taking. This simply means getting what you want requires you to know that you have it already.
