What I’ve come to understand is that we aint perfect, and that’s really fine, we are living life and we have all the reasons not to be perfect, no one has it all figured out. Sometimes we don’t feel wanted, sometimes we don’t feel pretty, we don’t feel confident or we even don’t have the zeal to battle the demons we face. Funny enough, sometimes the demons we battle with are ourselves, but I’ve realized that no matter what we endure or go through we are worthy. We don’t have to pay anyone for our greatness or pay anyone for our worthiness.

This is no ordinary blog post, it’s a reminder to my readers that, when life seems tough let’s remember to love our own. There’s nothing like one’s life is better than yours, there is you and the life you set for yourself. There is always beauty in the struggles, beauty in seeing yourself through the process. Listening to all the signals of our distress can be challenging, often we feel low, we feel pinned down and its okay, it’s part of the process. I have come to understand that life is no fairytale that once upon a time, is the actual decision of starting to do what you believe in. Am I where I want to be in life, Hell No! Not even close, but the decision to start is giving me the drive, the motivation, and the belief that my future actually counts.

> _Do not despise these small beginnings, for the Lord rejoices to see the work begin, to see the plumb line in Zerubbabel’s hand.”_ - **ZECHARIAH 4:10**

Whenever you feel the grip loosening, remember the strength comes from the Lord, as Steve Harvey says, don’t feel proud to pray, don’t feel ashamed to pray, and most importantly humble yourself in prayer. Remember there is always going to be that Lady or dude more beautiful and good-looking than yours, there are always going to be peers with better things (phones, clothes, jobs) than what you have. But always keep in mind, you’ll never be happy till you are in the right mind with yourself and most importantly if you love your own.

Thank you so much for the read, see you on the next one!
