The World Bank has announced its intention to pursue a loan and investment agreement worth Sh1.8 trillion for Kenya over the next three years. 

The Kenya Kwanza government will find economic relief in the package, which consists of conditional loans and guarantees worth hundreds of billions of shillings. 

The package will help to alleviate the governmentâ€™s struggle with mounting debts and a depreciating shilling. 

However, it also promises a fresh round of economic pain for Kenyans, said analysts.

This is because the World Bank is anticipated to require the implementation of more fiscal and economic reforms, which may involve imposing additional taxes and restructuring of State-owned agencies.
